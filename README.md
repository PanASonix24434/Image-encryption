This project is a simple assignment that allows users to encrypt an image file and then decrypt it back to its original form.

Features

1-Encrypt any image to protect its contents

2-Decrypt the encrypted image back to the original image without data loss

3-Easy-to-use interface for image file processing

4-Supports common image formats

How It Works
The program takes an input image, applies an encryption algorithm to scramble the data, and saves the encrypted file. When provided with the encrypted image, it can restore the original image by decrypting it.

Usage

1-Select an image file to encrypt

2-Run the encryption function to generate an encrypted file

3-Use the decryption function on the encrypted file to retrieve the original image

Assignment Objective
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the basic concepts of image encryption and decryption, showcasing how data can be transformed securely and restored accurately.
